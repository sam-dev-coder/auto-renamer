# auto-renamer
This tool "auto-rename" is a Python script designed to rename image files in a directory of folders for use in a supervised machine learning project. The project uses labelme to label training images, which creates a JSON file containing the labels for each image. The JSON file is then used to create a dataset and generate a label.png file for each training image. However, labelme creates a folder named after the JSON file and adds '_json' to the folder name, and within the folder are training images named 'img.png' and 'label.png', as well as other files. To use these labeled images for downstream processing, such as training a deep learning model, the label.png files must be renamed to match either the original name of the JSON file or the name of the corresponding image. This tool automates the renaming process, iterating over all subfolders in a parent directory and checking if the file name is 'img.png' or 'label.png'. If so, it renames the label.png file using the original name of the JSON file or the corresponding image, preserving the '.png' extension. This tool can be helpful when working with large datasets of labeled images and when consistency in file naming is important for downstream processing.
